# Centralized KYC System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Centralized KYC (Know Your Customer) System** is a secure and scalable platform designed to simplify and standardize the KYC verification process across multiple organizations. Instead of repeating KYC for every service, this system maintains a single verified KYC record for each user, which can be securely accessed by authorized institutions.

The project focuses on **data security, reusability, and efficiency**, reducing verification time, operational cost, and data duplication while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
